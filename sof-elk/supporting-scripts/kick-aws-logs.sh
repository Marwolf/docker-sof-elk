# This script will add a newline to any *.json file under /logstash/aws/ if it doesn't already have one.
# This is utterly absurd but AWS CloudTrail logs place all Records on one line within in JSON array and no newline charater.
# That treachery results in filebeat's reasonable line-based logic never seeing a file as "ready to read".
